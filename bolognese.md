# Pressure Cooker Bolognese Sauce
## Ingredients
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 lbs ground beef
- 1.5 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 cups chicken stock
- 2 packets unflavored gelatin
- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 2 anchovy fillets
- 1 carrot, diced
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 14 oz can peeled whole tomatoes
- 3/4 cup red wine
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- fresh ground pepper
- kosher salt

## Directions
1. Mix baking soda and kosher salt with 2 tablespoons of water, then pour over beef. Mix until combined, then set aside
2. Sprinkle gelatin over chicken stock and set aside
3. Heat butter on medium high until melted, then add anchovies and stir until the anchovies break apart and melt. 
4. Add carrots, onion, celery, and garlic. Cook until soft, about 10 minutes.
5. Add tomato paste and stir until it darkens, about a minute.
5. Add beef, season with salt (1tsp) and pepper. Cook, stirring regularly, until browned.
6. Add stock mixture, wine, and whole tomatoes (crushing them with your hand as you drop them in).
7. Close pressure cooker and cook at high pressure for 30 minutes. 
8. Release pressure, then leave uncovered and simmering for 30 minutes (I move it to a pot on the stove to make this easier to control, but if your pressure cooker can simmer you can leave it there and save the dishes).
9. Stir in remaining cream, salt and pepper to taste, and serve over pasta.
